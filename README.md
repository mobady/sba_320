# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Quran App

*Technologies Used:

-React.js: The primary framework used for building the user interface. It allows us to create reusable components like the Surah viewer and navigation bar.

-React Router: Used for handling navigation between different pages of the application, such as the homepage and Surah reading page.

-CSS: Custom CSS was used for styling the components, with flexbox used to ensure responsiveness. Styling includes a golden theme with hover effects for a modern and elegant design.

-JavaScript (ES6): Modern JavaScript features like hooks and ES6 syntax were utilized for managing the applicationâ€™s state and components.

-External APIs: We used an external API for fetching the Quran Surah data, allowing the app to dynamically load and display Surah content.

-Render.com: The application is hosted on Render for easy deployment and scalability,
